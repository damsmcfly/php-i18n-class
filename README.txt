This is a basic i18n class demonstrating how one might approach 
this problem in PHP.  It's been done before, but often I see 
this approached with message strings in a database, and I prefer 
text files, as they can be manipulated, versioned and transferred 
more easily.

The samples are taken from the Grails project, but I didn't bring 
them all over - just a couple to give you an idea of how to get 
started.
